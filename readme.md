# MIDI Synthesizer

This application was developed to work with a hardware synthesizer. Both, this software, and the synth were developed as a project for the course ENGG2800 - Team Project, at The University Of Queensland.

The people involved in the project included team member 1, team member 2 (the hardware guys), and me, Kaamraan Kamaal (working on the software).
