# MIDI Synthesizer

This application was developed to work with a hardware synthesizer. Both, this software, and the synth were developed as a project for the course ENGG2800 - Team Project, at The University Of Queensland.

The people involved in the project included team member 1, team member 2 (the hardware guys), and me, Kaamraan Kamaal (working on the software).

====================================================
====================================================
## To run the application:
- Ensure that your machine has JDK 8
- Execute the 'MIDIBlocks.jar' file.
### Alternatively
To build from source, the easiest way is to download the repository (`git clone` command), and running it using an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans etc.

## Virtual Piano
To use virtual piano, select that option and load the scales.csv file using the 'Load' button to load all the music scales.

### Note
There is no inherent sound output from the speakers as it is meant to pass MIDI data through the serial port to a special piece of hardare built as a part of this project. However, option to play sound through the speakers will be added soon.

## File Input
This option allows you to play any existing MIDI file.

Have fun!!
