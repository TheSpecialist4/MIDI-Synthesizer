Thank you for installing this software!!

This application was developed to work with a hardware synthesizer. Both, this software, and the synth were developed as a project for the course ENGG2800 - Team Project, at The University Of Queensland.

The people involved in the project included team member 1, team member 2 (the hardware guys), and me, Kaamraan Kamaal (working on the software).

Have fun with the software! Shoot any questions regarding the application, or the project in general to the following email address, and I'll be more than happy to assist you, with the software, or pass those questions on to the brains behind the hardware.

Have fun!!
